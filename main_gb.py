            The green economy refers to an economic system that aims to reduce environmental risks and ecological scarcities, while promoting sustainable development. It encompasses various sectors and industries that prioritize environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, and social inclusiveness. Key components of the green economy include renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, waste management, eco-friendly transportation, and green technologies.
            The transition to a green economy is essential for addressing pressing environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. By promoting sustainable practices and investments, the green economy offers opportunities for economic growth, job creation, and improved quality of life. It fosters innovation, resilience, and long-term prosperity, while mitigating the adverse impacts of unsustainable development on ecosystems and communities.

        * The cumulative green bond issuances by use of proceeds is categorized into 6 different categories.
        * Based on usage, the total amount of money raised through the issuance of green bonds in 2022 are mostly used to finance projects that falls into the Sustainable Energy & Transportation category.
        * More than half of the cumulative green bonds issuance, at around 63% are intended to fund Sustainable Energy & Transportation projects
        * At least 21% of the cumulative green bonds issuance are allocated to fund Climate Change Mitigation & Adaptation.
        * The rest four other categories are funded by 1-5% cumulative green bonds issuance, with the least funded being projects in the Social & Community Development category.

    * Currently there are 7 indicators regarding environmental protection expenditure by the IMF.
    * Each country might have different indicators or they might also only consider certain indicators in their budgeting.
    * There are countries like Indonesia that mostly allocate their budget to one of the indicators, which is 'expenditure on environmental protection'.
    * There are also countries that diversifies their budget according to all of the determined indicators, such as Austria.
    * Developed countries tend to be able to budget more for the enviromental protection expenditure, for example France which budgets 1-2% of GDP, Japan that budgets 1-2.8% of GDP, Netherlands that budgets 1-2.5% of GDP, etc.
    * This may be because developing countries have other urgent economic priorities, such as eradicating poverty, industrialization and economic diversification, infrastructure development, and more.
